# 📚 Overview
The Advanced OCR for Multi-Document Data Extraction project aims to develop an intelligent system that can automatically recognize, extract, and process structured and unstructured data from various document types, such as invoices, receipts, contracts, and forms. Using cutting-edge OCR techniques combined with machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), the system enhances document quality, detects key fields (e.g., dates, names, amounts), and converts printed or handwritten text into structured digital data. It ensures high accuracy through preprocessing (noise reduction, skew correction), rule-based or AI-driven data classification, and validation mechanisms. The extracted data is then stored in a structured format (e.g., databases, Excel) for seamless integration with business workflows.

# 🎯 Objectives
Extract and Process Text – Convert printed or handwritten text from various documents into a digital format using advanced OCR.
Identify and Structure Key Information – Automatically detect important details like dates, amounts, and names, organizing them into a structured format. 
Improve Accuracy and Reduce Manual Work – Use AI and preprocessing techniques to enhance recognition, minimize errors, and reduce human effort.
Automate Data Structuring – Organize extracted data into structured formats like databases.
Enable Seamless Integration – Ensure extracted data is compatible with business systems                                                                             for automation and efficiency.
